### Small things to-do:
- [x] Basic GUI & Menu
- [ ] Pretty GUI 
- [ ] Copy to pasteboard
- [ ] Export as PNG file
- [ ] Cancelable tasks 
- [x] Camera control

### Problems
- Using too many SIMD commands could block the main thread.
- Inconsistent Metal shader running results on AMD and Intel GPU.
