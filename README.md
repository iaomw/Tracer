- [x] [Ray Tracing: The Next Week](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)
- [x] [Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html)
- [ ] [Metal API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal)
    - [ ] Compute kernel BVH & SVGF
    - [ ] MPS Acceleration & SVGF
    - [x] pcg-random
- [ ] [**Physically Based Rendering** __*third edition*__](http://www.pbr-book.org/)
    - [ ] Volume Rendering
    - [ ] Metropolis Light Transport
   
- [ ] [TU Wien Rendering](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Rendering/VU.SS2020.html)

### Small things to-do:
- [x] Basic GUI & Menu
- [ ] Pretty GUI 
- [ ] Copy to pasteboard
- [ ] Export as PNG file
- [ ] Cancelable tasks

### Problems
- Using too many SIMD commands could block the main thread.
- Inconsistent Metal shader running results on AMD and Intel GPU.
